### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model and Architecture

For the classification of combined `cultivated1st` and `cultivated2nd` leaf images, a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, named `LeafCNN`, was developed using PyTorch. The model was designed to process two-channel input images (ECT data and binary mask) of dimensions 64x64 pixels.

The `LeafCNN` architecture consists of three convolutional blocks, each comprising a `Conv2d` layer, followed by `BatchNorm2d` for improved training stability and accelerated convergence, a `ReLU` activation function, and a `MaxPool2d` layer for spatial downsampling. The filter sizes and counts for these blocks are as follows:

* **Block 1:** 32 filters, 3x3 kernel.
* **Block 2:** 64 filters, 3x3 kernel.
* **Block 3:** 128 filters, 3x3 kernel.

Following the convolutional feature extraction, the flattened output from the final pooling layer is passed into a fully connected classifier. This classifier includes a `Linear` layer with 512 units, followed by another `ReLU` activation and a `Dropout` layer (with a 0.5 probability) to mitigate overfitting. The final output layer is a `Linear` layer that produces logits for each of the `N` leaf classes identified across the combined datasets.
